    <p>All time classic japanese Ramen recipe, guaranteed to please everyone!</p>
    <p>Easy to make, only a few ingredients needed.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking sake</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring eggs to room temperature by soaking them in warm water for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a low boil.</li>
        <li>Carefully pierce the bottom of each egg with thumb tack. Gently lower eggs into the boiling water.</li>

        <li>Carefully peel cooled eggs; try to start from the middle of the shell and work you way up and down.</li>
        <li>Place whole peeled eggs in marinade. Refrigerate for at least 2 to 4 hours, or up to 2 days for stronger flavor, turning eggs every 30 minutes or as often as you prefer.</li>
